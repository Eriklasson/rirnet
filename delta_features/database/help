1. create a new folder under the database-folder and give the new folder a name - this will be the database name
2. copy _default.yaml to the new folder and rename it db_setup.yaml
3. adjust db_setup.yaml to suite your needs
4. run
    python *PATH-TO-database.py* *PATH-TO-NEW-FOLDER*
    e.g. (if standing in the database-folder, and naming the new database
    db1) 
    python ../rirnet/database.py db1

    the database will now build based on the configuration in db_setup.yaml
